# ABSTRACT



# BACKGROUND





# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  


Fill in here, the question we want to answer... e.g. What bird species is acting as WNV amplifying host in Salt Lake City?

## Hypothesis 

Fill in hypothesis... e.g. House finches are acting as important amplifying hosts of WNV in Salt Lake City.
  
## Prediction





# METHODS

Collection of samples was done with mosqutio traps and blood meal samples were collected with a lysis protocol where DNA is extracted and then sequenced. 


## Fill in first analysis
```{r plot-state-data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=7}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the CSV file
state_data <- read_csv("state_data.csv")

# Clean and separate the "Rate (SE)" column into two numeric columns
state_data <- state_data %>%
  separate(`Rate (SE)`, into = c("Rate", "SE"), sep = " \\(", remove = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    Rate = as.numeric(Rate),
    SE = as.numeric(str_remove(SE, "\\)"))
  )

# Create the plot
ggplot(state_data, aes(x = reorder(State, Rate), y = Rate)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Rate - SE, ymax = Rate + SE), width = 0.3) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Rates by State with Standard Error",
    x = "State",
    y = "Rate (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(r = 5)),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 15, 10, 15)
  )


```







House finch GLM: 

Does house finch have an effect by location positive +/- (binary)? by location positivity rate? 

```{r}
#glm with house finch alone against binary +/_
glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)

#glm with house-finch alone against positivity rate
glm2 <- glm(loc_rate ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix)
summary(glm2)
```


# DISCUSSION

Much of this Data helps us to see a correlation between urban populations and where some of these species are likely to be found like the house sparrows and Mourning doves. This leads to a higher transmission rate in these species. supporting this is a graphic from "Molaei G et,al"

```{r northeast-wnv, fig.cap="West Nile Virus activity in the Northeastern United States.", fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
# Insert the JPEG file directly using knitr::include_graphics()
knitr::include_graphics("Northeast WNV.jpg")
```

## Interpretation - fill in analysis

This graphs helps to show the susceptibility of this virus across different species of bird. Most notable to this report which explores three commonly being influenced by this virus those being: House finch, House Sparrow and the Mourning dove. we see much higher rates of blood meal rates of WNV which drew us to questions about the behavioral and morphological differences in these species that may raise their rates. 

## Interpretation - fill in analysis/plot

This GLM test helps us to determine the percentage chance that these events are statistical significant and whether their relationships can help us to draw conclusions from this data. Notably there are extremely low P-values which helps us to know that there is not correlation in this data set by chance. 

# CONCLUSION

While challenging to arrive at and spseific conclusions there are still some trends here that we can see. Due to behavior patterns it seems to be apparent that there are patterns with many species of these birds and how they come in contact with this virus.
In future studys it may be of intrest to study these prone species birds more (house_finch,house_sparrow and american_robin) specifically of any morphological and an immunosuseptibulity assay.
